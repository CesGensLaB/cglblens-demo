# Run Compare dat files thanks to mapping

**Linux Only**
(the command sh)

## Instructions

1. `cd` to this folder
2. Run `cglblens run .`

## Explanations

 Cglblens is configured to map .dat files to .txt files. This means that it will treat .dat files as if they were .txt files.
 In our report, we will have an error.
